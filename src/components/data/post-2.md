Documentation is the bane of my existance. But I am the first to admit, it has saved my life more than once, weather it was an email I had to refer back to or a steps to follow to fix an error. One of my recent goals was to document as much as I can but the question was how, and where. Enter github, gitpages and MarkDown.
